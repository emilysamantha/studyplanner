# Study Plan Recommendation System

## What is it?

This study plan recommendation system can suggest a tailored study timetable based on a student's daily calendar, subjects studied, and upcoming assessments.

## How does it work?

1. Put in the subjects to study for, along with their upcoming assessments. The assessments should have a title, a date, and an optional duration. A subject can be marked as having a higher priority.
2. Put in any unavailable times into the calendar.
3. The system will recommend a study timetable based on the student's available times. Subjects with more upcoming assessments and a higher priority will be recommended first.

## Future extension

The system is modelled such that more categories can easily be added. 
Let's say, a person would also like to have a training plan for a sports they play, a meal prepping plan for the week, or a recommended schedule for their hobbies. 
Each of these categories have different ways of determining a suitable time. 
A training plan may require rest days in between, a meal prepping plan may take into account meal times, and a hobbies schedule may only be for the weekends.
